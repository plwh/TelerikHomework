A string is a sequence of characters stored in a certain address in memory.
Remember the type char? In the variable of type char we can record only one 
character. Where it is necessary to process more than one character then strings come to our aid.
Most important string processing members are:
- Length, this[], Compare(str1, str2), IndexOf(str), LastIndexOf(str), Substring(startIndex, length), Replace(oldStr, newStr), Remove(startIndex, length),
ToLower(), ToUpper()
