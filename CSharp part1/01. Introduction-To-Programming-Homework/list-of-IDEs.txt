1.SharpDevelop

SharpDevelop is a freely available open source IDE built with the C# language. It provides a great example of what you can achieve with the .NET platform, but it doesn't restrict you to C#. It is similar to Visual Studio .NET in both appearance and features. It allows you to develop all types of applications including ASP.NET, Windows Forms, and console.

2.Eclipse

Eclipse is an open, extensible IDE framework developed by IBM. It was originally developed for the Java language. It is built on a mechanism for discovering, integrating, and running modules called plug-ins. That is, a tool provider writes a tool as a separate plug-in that operates on files in the workspace and surfaces its tool-specific user interface in the IDE. One such plug-in is the C# Plugin from Improve Technologies. 

3.PrimalCode

PrimalCode is a commercially available .NET IDE available from Sapien.

In addition to .NET support, PrimalCode supports more than 30 languages including Perl, classic ASP, PHP, ColdFusion, VBScript, JSP, and WMI.

4.MonoDevelop

MonoDevelop is a freely available IDE for the Linux platform. It is connected with the Mono project. It is a simple IDE allowing development of C# code.

It is still in the early stages of development so it will continue to add features, including support for building GUI interfaces.

5.NetBeans
